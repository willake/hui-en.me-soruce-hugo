title: "Secret Triangle"
ogTitle: "Secret Triangle | Hui En \"Willake\" Lin"
ogDescription: "Secret Triangle was my second game made in Unity. 
            In contrast to I Just Want To Cook, which players interact with games by keyboards only, the main input of this game was by mouse. 
            In this experience, I learned a different aspect of using ray cast. 
            In addition, the combat system of the game was turn base, implementing this system helped me acquire the knowledge of state machine."
