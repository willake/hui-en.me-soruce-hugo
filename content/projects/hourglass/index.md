ogTitle: "Hourglass | Hui En &quot;Willake&quot; Lin"
ogDescription: "Hourglass was a graduate project in my final year of university. 
            My main duty was implementing gameplay mechanics, including character movement, object interaction and boss fighting. 
            In addition, I imported shaders bought from Unity Assets Store to improv animations, making them more vigorous. 
            In this experience, collaborating within the team was the most valuable skills that I acquired."
