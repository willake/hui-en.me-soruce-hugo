description: "I Just Want to Cook is the game I made In my first Unity class in university. 
            Restricting by teacher, this game was designed to be a local multiple player game. 
            The game mechanic was designed by myself, inspiring from the conventional game, hide-and-seek. 
            There are two characters, the hunter and the rabbit. 
            The objective of hunter is to catch the rabbit, and the goal of rabbit is to find ingredients for cooking."
