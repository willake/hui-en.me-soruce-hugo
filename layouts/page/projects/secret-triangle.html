            Secret Triangle was my second game made in Unity. 
            In contrast to I Just Want To Cook, which players interact with games by keyboards only, the main input of this game was by mouse. 
            In this experience, I learned a different aspect of using ray cast. 
            In addition, the combat system of the game was turn base, implementing this system helped me acquire the knowledge of state machine.

            Ray casting plays an important role in game development. 
            For example, in my previous project, picking which objects was determined by the ray shoot from player character. 
            Similarly, moving character by mouse was executed with the ray shoot from camera.

            Turn-Base is an interesting combat system. 
            It gives player more time to think their tactics without losing the excite mood. 
            Initially, I was struggle with organizing the whole code base because I used a lot of if statement to maintain the whole system. 
            It was not very efficiant and clean. After searching google for better solution, state machine is a good one.
